# Project 3 Rios Pizza

## User Story
AS A pizza bar buisness owner
I WANT customers to be able to look at our website to view our menu items and deals
WHEN the user opens the pizza icons I want them to see the ingredients and the prices

## Description 
This is a local pizza bar website for my project 3 assignment.  

On the navbar click the page you want to access. On the pizza page click any of the pizza icons to find out what the ingredients/prices are.

For future plans, I am creating a login/sign up page to access exclusive membership deals. 

To run locally, cd into client "\project3-rios-pizza-zd\client", then npm start.
